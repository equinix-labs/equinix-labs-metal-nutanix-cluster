# Conclusion

Thank you for participating in the workshop! Let's recap some of the key takeways that we've learned:

- We built on our existing familiarity with Equinix Metal and Terraform to create a Nutanix cluster
- We accessed our Nutanix cluster running in a private network via a bastion host
- We deployed a VM to our Nutanix cluster, using cloud-init to add a user

## Next Steps

Now that you have a working Nutanix cluster and are able to access the Prism UI, we recommend diving into the learning resources provided by Nutanix:

- Step through the [Nutanix cloud-init Lab](https://www.nutanix.dev/lab_content/cloud-init-lab/) to deploy a VM on your Nutanix cluster
- Check out [Nutanix University on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@NutanixUniversity) for guided walkthroughs of Nutanix use cases
